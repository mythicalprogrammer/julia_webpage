      		<h4>Julia is fast!</h4>
      		<p>Julia was designed from the beginning for <a href="/benchmarks">high performance</a>. Julia programs compile to efficient native code for multiple platforms via LLVM.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 feature">
            <h4>Dynamic</h4>
            <p>Julia is dynamically-typed, feels like a scripting language, and has good support for interactive use.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 feature">
            <h4>Optionally Typed</h4>
            <p>Julia has a rich language of descriptive datatypes, and type declarations can be used to clarify and solidify programs.</p>

      <h4>General</h4>
      <p>
        Julia uses multiple dispatch as a paradigm, making it easy to express
        many object-oriented and functional programming patterns.
        The standard library provides asynchronous I/O, process control, logging, profiling,
        a package manager, and more.

      <h4>Technical</h4>
      <p>
        Julia excels at numerical computing. Its syntax is great for math, many numeric
        datatypes are supported, and parallelism is available out of the box.
        Julia's multiple dispatch is a natural fit for defining number and array-like
        datatypes.

    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 feature">
      <h4>Composable</h4>
      <p>
        Julia packages naturally work well together. Matrices of unit quantities, or data table
        columns of currencies and colors, just work â€” and with good performance.
